# Simple Calculator Code 💻

A basic calculator program written in C that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## How it Works 🤔
1. Choose an Operation 🧮: The program prompts the user to enter an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /, %).
2. Enter Numbers 📝: The user is asked to enter two numbers.
3. Perform Calculation 🔥: The program performs the chosen operation on the two numbers and displays the result.

## Supported Operations 📚
- Addition ➕: a + b
- Subtraction ➖: a - b
- Multiplication ✖: a * b
- Division ➗: a / b (integer division)
- Modulus %: a % b (remainder of division)

## Example Usage 📊

 [+,-,*,/,...] :
+
1st no.
10
2nd No.
5
15 


## Code Explanation 📝
The code uses simple if-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input. The program uses scanf to read user input and printf to display the result.

### Note 📝
#### - This program performs integer division, so the result of division will be truncated to an integer.
#### - If the user enters an invalid operation, the program will display "Wrong input".
