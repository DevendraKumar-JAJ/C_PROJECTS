# Shape Calculator 💻

A comprehensive calculator program written in C that calculates various properties of 2D and 3D shapes, including area, perimeter, volume, and more.

## Supported Shapes 📚
### - 2D Shapes 📏:
    - Rectangle
    - Square
    - Circle
    - Triangle
    - Rhombus
### - 3D Shapes 🌐:
    - Cube
    - Cuboid
    - Sphere

## Properties Calculated 🤔
### - 2D Shapes:
    - Area
    - Perimeter
    - Diagonal (for rectangles and rhombuses)
    - Side length (for squares and rhombuses)
### - 3D Shapes:
    - Surface area
    - Volume

## How to Use 📊
1. Choose Shape Type 🤔: Select whether you want to calculate properties for a 2D or 3D shape.
2. Choose Shape 📝: Select the specific shape you want to calculate properties for.
3. Enter Values 📊: Enter the required values for the shape, such as side lengths or radii.
4. View Results 📈: The program will display the calculated properties for the shape.

## Example Usage 📊

#### -Enter Shape Type    [      1_2D.      2_3D.      ]      :      1

#### -Enter shape name    [      1_for Rectangle.      2_for Square.      3_for Circle.      4_for Triangle.      5_for Rhombus      ]      :      1

#### -Enter    [      1_for find Area.      2_for find Perimeter.      3_for find Diagonal.      4_for find Length.      5_for find Width.      ]      :      1

#### -Enter Length of Rectangle.      :      10
#### -Enter Width of Rectangle.      :      5
#### -Area of Rectangle is =      50.000000


## Code Explanation 📝
### The code uses a menu-driven approach to allow users to select the shape and property they want to calculate. The program uses switch statements to determine which shape and property to calculate, and then uses formulas to calculate the desired property.
