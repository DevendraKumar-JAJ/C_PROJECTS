# Data Storage Unit Converter README 📦

## Introduction 📚

This C program is a data storage unit converter that allows users to convert between different units of digital information, such as bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, and petabytes. 🤔

#### Features 🌟

- Convert between different data storage units, including:
    - Bits (b) to bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and petabytes (PB)
    - Bytes (B) to bits (b), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and petabytes (PB)
    - Kilobytes (KB) to bits (b), bytes (B), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and petabytes (PB)
    - Megabytes (MB) to bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and petabytes (PB)
    - Gigabytes (GB) to kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), terabytes (TB), and petabytes (PB)
    - Terabytes (TB) to megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and petabytes (PB)
    - Petabytes (PB) to gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB)

### Usage 🤔

1. Run the program and select the unit to work with by entering the corresponding number (1-7).
2. Select the conversion type by entering the corresponding number.
3. Enter the value to be converted.
4. The program will display the converted value.

### Code Structure 💻

The program uses nested switch statements to handle different conversion types and performs the necessary calculations based on the user's input.

### Example Use Cases 📝

- Convert 1024 bytes to kilobytes: Select option 2 (bytes) and then option 2 (bytes to kilobytes). Enter 1024 when prompted.
- Convert 1 gigabyte to megabytes: Select option 5 (gigabytes) and then option 2 (gigabytes to megabytes). Enter 1 when prompted.

### Requirements 📦

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries (stdio.h, conio.h)

### Contributing 🤝
